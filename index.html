					Hailing from Portland, Oregon, I am a dedicated software developer. <br /><br />
					My dedication has taken me from Lewis & Clark College for a B.A. in Computer Science & Mathematics, 
					to University of Oregon, where I am earning my Masters in Computer Sciece, with an emphasis on 
					Artificial Intelligence.twitter
				</p>
				<p>
					As a student, I spent 6 months working with Professor Daniel Lowd on researching spam occurences on Twitter.
					We examined the social web and its relation to the probability of a user being a spammer. I have spent the last
					year acting as a teaching assistant for 100 level classes, resulting in me leading multiple labs of 20+ students
					each quarter.
				</p>
				<p>
					As a professional developer, I have created and supported business class software, managed databases,
					maintained legacy programs and websites, and worked on Android applications. 
				</p>
				<p>
					My most recent project was <a href="http://www.flaremailapp.com">FlareMail</a>, an Android application 
					I did as an employee of <a href="http://www.uncorkedstudios.com">Uncorked Studios</a>. 
					I was the creator and sole Android developer on the project. A gallery of FlareMail screenshots can be seen
					<a id="flaremail1" rel="flaremail" class="fancyImg" href="images/flareshot1.png">here</a>. It is available on
					<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.flaremail">Google Play</a>.

				</p>
				<p>
					Before that, I worked on a couple large projects for Uncorked Studios. One was the 
					<a href="http://blog.safecast.org/">Safecast</a> website. Safecast is an international, non-profit project 
					created as a result of the earthquake that hit Japan in 2011. Safecast collects and provides up-to-date information
					about radiation levels in Japan, collected by independent individuals and organizations. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The other large project was an experimental mobile 3D mapping project for a very well-respected ad agency. Sadly,
					this project never saw the light of day, but did provide me with a learning experience about seeing a project 
					get shelved, working with a group of many developers across multiple platforms, and dealing with rapid prototyping and 
					ever-shifting design concepts and designs, all while working on a platform I had no prior experience on. As a result,
					I came out the other side a more well-rounded developer. 
					
					
				</p>
				<p>
					In my spare time, I am studying OpenGL ES on the Android system. Although
					I do spend a large amount of time on Android, my professional interests are pretty varied. I enjoy creating
					projects, whether for desktop applications or mobile, for the web or otherwise.
				</p>
				<p>
					My resume is available <a href="NickTillerResume.pdf">here</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					I am looking for a great team and great projects. If you think I would be a good addition to your team, I would
					love to talk. I can be reached via email at <a id="emailSpan" href="mailto:nicholas.s.tiller@gmail.com">

					I was born in Mesa, Arizona in 1987. I moved to Idaho in 7th grade, where my family moved around a bit
					before settling in 
					<a id="goodingImg" class="fancyImg" title="Not exactly a cultural hub." href="images/gooding.jpg">
						Gooding, Idaho,
					</a>where I attended Gooding High School. After graduation, I packed up, and moved to Portland, Oregon,
					where I attended Lewis & Clark College, getting my BA in Computer Science & Mathematics. I spent a year
					in the "real world", working for <a href="http://www.safetec.net">Safetec Compliance Systems</a>, making
					business software. Realizing that I was not done with the academic world, I moved to Eugene, Oregon, where
					I am currently a Computer Science Masters student, when I'm not doing work for <a href="http://www.uncorkedstudios.com">
						Uncorked Studios.

					I spend my free time <a id="climbingImg" class="fancyImg" title="I am on the left." href="images/climbing.jpg">
						rock climbing,
					</a>playing guitar, reading, playing video games, programming, and listening to a lot of music (I am currently
